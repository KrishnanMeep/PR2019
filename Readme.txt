PR 2019 Assignment Sem II 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The assignment was on discriminant functions based on the Bayseian classifier. The questions
for the assignment are in the pdf called PR_Assignment1_DF_SPR2019.
The other two pdfs contain the code, plots and explanations or answers to the questions,
how I came to the solution implemented.

One of the datasets is synthetic data from Duda Hart, chapter 2. The other is the Iris
dataset.
